    "In this project, we will build an end-to-end business intelligence solution to analyze sales and supply chain data. We will start by integrating data from different sources to build a data warehouse, ensuring we have a single source of truth that is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis and reporting. Then, we will use the data warehouse to answer key business questions that will help stakeholders make data-driven decisions based on actionable insights.\n",
